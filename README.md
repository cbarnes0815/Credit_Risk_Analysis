# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk.
We adopted the following procedure:
- oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
We will evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
